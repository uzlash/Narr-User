After all, Stamp’s <em><a href=\"https://www.idrc.ca/en/book/technology-gender-and-power-africa\">Technology, Gender, and Power in Africa</a> </em>was first written in 1989 when I read it on microfiche, and little seems to have changed.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ictworks.org/category/agriculture/\">Agriculture</a> is sexist. Poverty is sexist. And certainly, technology is sexist. These are three tenets that anyone working at the intersection of development and technology should inherently know, without the assistance of a “gender specialist.”</p>\n<p>How is it that technology advocates remain so blind to gender (and other) biases that are imbued in many software platforms and services?</p>\n<p>Far earlier than Stamp, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law\">Conway warned us about this phenomenon in technology in 1967</a>, that any technology reflects the values of its creator. So when a white western software developer creates a crop management application for women in rural Mozambique – even if this developer served in the Peace Corps in Mali 15 years ago and focused on poultry initiatives – the result is not going to be a raging success.</p>\n<h2>Women Are Not Using ICT4Ag Solutions</h2>\n<p>In fact, our best <a href=\"https://www.ictworks.org/tag/agritech/\">AgTech minds</a> collectively do not have a stellar track record outside of their good intentions.

Rural <a href=\"https://www.ictworks.org/tag/smallholder-farmers/\">smallholder farmer women</a> do not live in vacuums.

Employ Text-free User Interfaces</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ictworks.org/how-interactive-radio-can-improve-feedback-and-accountability-in-agriculture/\">Community radio</a>, Interactive Voice Response (IVR) and non-mobile phone solutions. How else do you expect to reach low-literacy populations, populations without access to smartphones (or who have such old smartphones that they cannot run any new applications), and people for whom phone airtime and charging is simply a tax (yes, most of these are women)?</p>\n<p>Medhi et al’s seminal <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/medhi_ictd2006.pdf\"><em>Text-Free User Interfaces for Illiterate and Semiliterate Users</em> </a>should inform anyone’s work to reach hard-to reach populations. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7GN3q7katA\">Amplio’s Talking Book</a> has been a huge success in Ghana for the very reason that it is not a mobile phone, has a one-to-many model and does not get stolen or appropriated by other family members.</p>\n<p>Partner with the people who know what they are doing. <a href=\"https://viamo.io/\">VIAMO</a> is expanding for a reason, and now they have added basic digital literacy skills for women to their offerings. <a href=\"https://gramvaani.org/?tag=ivr\">Gram Vaani</a> has advanced tagging and search features built into IVR.

A little public recognition, especially for women, goes a long way to change the gender dynamic.</p>\n<h2>3. De-gendered technology</h2>\n<p>When gender complexity is just too big of a barrier to work with and around, de-gender the technology. <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261846916_Minding_the_gaps_Cultural_technical_and_gender-based_barriers_to_mobile_use_in_oral-language_Berber_communities_in_Morocco\">Dodson’s work in Morocco</a> removes the strict cultural mores that prohibit unrelated men and women from working together and is moving toward a fully symbol- and numeric-based system, where “Phone 6,” not Fatima, is calling Marouane.</p>\n<p>In a time when global newspapers are filled with stories of honor killings based on <a href=\"https://www.ictworks.org/missed-opportunities-in-using-tech-to-fight-violence-against-women/\">women’s social media use</a>, women’s safety and empowerment can go hand in hand when we are both creative and have done deep ethnographies in areas where gendered technology use is sanctioned. Under what conditions can women use technology?</p>\n<p>This needs to be the first question, which often requires extensive work with power-brokers in the community to achieve explicit permission.</p>\n<h2>4. Confidence and training</h2>\n<p>Women will not use mobile phones or the internet if they feel they are too stupid to use them. Confidence is as much of a requirement as connectivity. Combine your AgTech app with programming that encourages and builds women’s agency, both online and in real life.</p>\n<p>Explore the power of technology-mediated venues to promote women’s knowledge and accomplishments. Early in my research career, we studied the impact of women reporting agricultural information on <a href=\"https://www.ictworks.org/tag/fm-radio/\">community radio</a>; their own husbands were amazed that their wives were so smart and commented: “If the radio station thinks my wife is wise, I should listen to her.” Technology can amplify empowerment.</p>\n<h2>5. Female leadership and a seat at the table</h2>\n<p>Promote the men and employers that make sure women are included in all aspects of using AgTech. Go as far to mandate women’s involvement and leadership.</p>\n<p>Deploy solutions specifically to women – they are the ones who are going to stay in the community in most cases, when men have to migrate to cities or countries abroad (not always the case, of course, especially with domestic work and trafficking). Take a page from an organization like <a href=\"http://www.afchix.org/projects/\">AfChix</a>, who sets up community networks – community-based ISPs – in places where providing connectivity is simply too cost-prohibitive for commercial players.</p>\n<p>Women are the network managers, engineers and trainers. AfChix has upended the usual paradigm and created a new social norm, where women = internet.</p>\n<p>These are but a few positive examples, as unfortunately, there are far more failures than successes. The evidence and models are out there, so why are we still talking about how women are not using AgTech? It is not the women. It is us.</p>\n<p><em>By <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/revisterling/\">Revi Sterling</a>, Director, DAI and originally published as <a href=\"https://www.agrilinks.org/post/why-women-arent-using-your-ag-app\">Why Women Aren’t Using Your Ag App</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ictworks.org/women-agritech-application-innovation/\">5 Ways to Get Women to Use Your AgriTech Application Innovation</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ictworks.org\">ICTworks</a>.</p>\n",

Under what conditions can women use technology?\nThis needs to be the first question, which often requires extensive work with power-brokers in the community to achieve explicit permission.\n4. Confidence and training\nWomen will not use mobile phones or the internet if they feel they are too stupid to use them. Confidence is as much of a requirement as connectivity. Combine your AgTech app with programming that encourages and builds women’s agency, both online and in real life.\nExplore the power of technology-mediated venues to promote women’s knowledge and accomplishments. Early in my research career, we studied the impact of women reporting agricultural information on community radio; their own husbands were amazed that their wives were so smart and commented: “If the radio station thinks my wife is wise, I should listen to her.” Technology can amplify empowerment.\n5. Female leadership and a seat at the table\nPromote the men and employers that make sure women are included in all aspects of using AgTech. Go as far to mandate women’s involvement and leadership.\nDeploy solutions specifically to women – they are the ones who are going to stay in the community in most cases, when men have to migrate to cities or countries abroad (not always the case, of course, especially with domestic work and trafficking). Take a page from an organization like AfChix, who sets up community networks – community-based ISPs – in places where providing connectivity is simply too cost-prohibitive for commercial players.\nWomen are the network managers, engineers and trainers. AfChix has upended the usual paradigm and created a new social norm, where women = internet.\nThese are but a few positive examples, as unfortunately, there are far more failures than successes. The evidence and models are out there, so why are we still talking about how women are not using AgTech? It is not the women. It is us.\nBy Revi Sterling, Director, DAI and originally published as Why Women Aren’t Using Your Ag App\nThe post 5 Ways to Get Women to Use Your AgriTech Application Innovation appeared first on ICTworks.",

They play a critical role in financing economic activities that private sector commercial banks are unwilling and/or unable to finance. This includes small business, infrastructure, trade, or other social and development objectives in emerging markets (as well as many developed ones).</p>\n<p>These public sector entities (sometimes public-private partnerships [PPPs]) generally operate with a dual mandate — commercial returns and social impact.</p>\n<h2>Development Banks and Digital Financial Services</h2>\n<p>In current times, as <a href=\"https://www.ictworks.org/tag/digital-financial-services/\">digital financial services</a> evolve, and citizens begin to place higher expectations on governments to keep up with the internet age, and COVID-19 has exposed frailties in analog institutions across the world, I’ve been thinking about the role public development banks play in delivering impact and value to increasingly digital societies.</p>\n<p>The last <a href=\"http://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/977821525438071799/pdf/2017-Survey-of-National-development-banks.pdf\">World Bank survey of development banks</a> made a fleeting comment: “<em>more recently, development banks are being established to finance green projects and accelerate adoption of the digital economy</em>.”</p>\n<p>Yet, I’ve seen little discussion of development banks involved in digital. So I talked to <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/abiodunijaware/\">Abiodun Ijaware,</a> Head of IT at the <a href=\"https://www.devbankng.com\">Development Bank of Nigeria</a>. He and I discussed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How should a PDB improve access and delivery of financial services in a digital age?</li>\n<li>How can a PDB stay on the front foot of digitalisation?</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>4 Ways Public Development Banks Can Digitize</h2>\n<h3>1. Get your house in order.</h3>\n<p>It sounds common sense, but if a development bank wants to contribute to creating a strong digital economy, it first needs to be a digital organisation itself.</p>\n<p>Younger PDBs have the advantage of birth within the internet-age. The Development Bank of Nigeria (DBN), for example, began operations in 2018. It started with digital in mind, allowing it to adopt data technologies, <a href=\"https://www.ictworks.org/tag/cloud-computing/\">cloud services</a> and lay a strong foundation for digital growth.  It has avoided painful departure from old IT infrastructure or manual processes.</p>\n<p>Alongside its 2018 Corporate Strategic Plan, DBN created a specific digital strategy with three tiers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Objectives and plans for internal digitalisation;</li>\n<li>The way it employs digitalisation to relate with vendors and other financial institutions that it partners with for lending;</li>\n<li>How it impacts target constituencies (micro-small and medium enterprises) through digital services.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, many PDBs are much older (35% surveyed by the <a href=\"https://www.ictworks.org/tag/world-bank/\">World Bank</a> were established between 1945 and 1979.) Too often these institutions rely on siloed (and often outdated) software solutions and cumbersome manual processes. Others seem to feel they have achieved their pinnacle of digitalisation by having a website and a portion of staff communicating via email.</p>\n<p>To serve a smartphone generation and digitally active citizens, these PDBs first need to undergo a digital transformation internally. Many commercial banks have made this transition; PDBs can learn from them. I liked what the <a href=\"https://www.centerforfinancialinclusion.org\">Center for Financial Inclusion</a> writes as <a href=\"https://www.centerforfinancialinclusion.org/10-ways-to-organize-for-digital-innovation-in-financial-services\">“breaking” traditional rules</a> which no longer work in an internet era; this means questioning the way things are handled from citizens or partners’ perspectives.</p>\n<p>The Development Bank of Nigeria has aimed to be ‘asset-light’.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Public Development Banks (PDB) exist in most countries. They play a critical role in financing economic activities that private sector commercial banks are unwilling and/or unable to finance. This includes small business, infrastructure, trade, or other social and development objectives in emerging markets (as well as many developed ones).\nThese public sector entities (sometimes public-private partnerships [PPPs]) generally operate with a dual mandate — commercial returns and social impact.\nDevelopment Banks and Digital Financial Services\nIn current times, as digital financial services evolve, and citizens begin to place higher expectations on governments to keep up with the internet age, and COVID-19 has exposed frailties in analog institutions across the world, I’ve been thinking about the role public development banks play in delivering impact and value to increasingly digital societies.\nThe last World Bank survey of development banks made a fleeting comment: “more recently, development banks are being established to finance green projects and accelerate adoption of the digital economy.”\nYet, I’ve seen little discussion of development banks involved in digital. So I talked to Abiodun Ijaware, Head of IT at the Development Bank of Nigeria. He and I discussed:\nHow should a PDB improve access and delivery of financial services in a digital age?\nHow can a PDB stay on the front foot of digitalisation?\n4 Ways Public Development Banks Can Digitize\n1. Get your house in order.\nIt sounds common sense, but if a development bank wants to contribute to creating a strong digital economy, it first needs to be a digital organisation itself.\nYounger PDBs have the advantage of birth within the internet-age. The Development Bank of Nigeria (DBN), for example, began operations in 2018. It started with digital in mind, allowing it to adopt data technologies, cloud services and lay a strong foundation for digital growth.  It has avoided painful departure from old IT infrastructure or manual processes.\nAlongside its 2018 Corporate Strategic Plan, DBN created a specific digital strategy with three tiers:\nObjectives and plans for internal digitalisation;\nThe way it employs digitalisation to relate with vendors and other financial institutions that it partners with for lending;\nHow it impacts target constituencies (micro-small and medium enterprises) through digital services.\nHowever, many PDBs are much older (35% surveyed by the World Bank were established between 1945 and 1979.) Too often these institutions rely on siloed (and often outdated) software solutions and cumbersome manual processes. Others seem to feel they have achieved their pinnacle of digitalisation by having a website and a portion of staff communicating via email.\nTo serve a smartphone generation and digitally active citizens, these PDBs first need to undergo a digital transformation internally. Many commercial banks have made this transition; PDBs can learn from them. I liked what the Center for Financial Inclusion writes as “breaking” traditional rules which no longer work in an internet era; this means questioning the way things are handled from citizens or partners’ perspectives.\nThe Development Bank of Nigeria has aimed to be ‘asset-light’. For older, big IT-system riddled development banks becoming a digital institution may involve as much shedding of systems, vendors, and processes as it does building new digital infrastructure.\nStarting with digital strategy, working to build internal human capacity, partnering to find the right applications and solutions, and automating foundational internal processes as much as possible are key.\n2. Understand primary ‘users’ and improve their UI.\nMany PDBs are ‘Tier 2 lenders’. This means they distribute loans through other ‘participating’ financial institutions (PFI) — usually local microfinance institutions, commercial banks, money unions etc.\nThis has derisking benefits as well as opportunities for the PDB to expand its reach by leveraging local commercial banks’ existing branch networks to serve the needs of target beneficiary citizens (micro and small businesses in the case of the Development Bank of Nigeria, for example). The local banks [or PFIs] are customer facing; they undertake customer due diligence and deliver the financial service.\nTier 1 PDBs, on the other hand, lend directly to citizens, project sponsors, businesses, etc. (and some PDBs are mixed Tier 1 and 2 lenders).\nThe direct or primary users of a PDB’s services matter. This subtle difference between Tier 1 and Tier 2 users will mean the goals, questions asked, user pain points, and subsequent prioritisation of digitalisation and internal process reform will diverge between Tier 1 and Tier 2 lenders.\nCitizens are extremely important to both Tier 1 and 2 PDBs. But Tier 2 cannot serve general citizens best until it serves its partner participating financial institutions (PFIs) well. This means thinking through the digital interface and processes that partner PFIs experience for them to apply for, disburse, and monitor/report on funds.\nOf course, the process of understanding users’ needs—be they direct citizen borrowers or other financial institutions — is not dissimilar. Clarity in objectives and desired change is critical. Will digitalisation provide… easier? clearer? faster? more transparent and seamless?… portfolio monitoring? Loan disbursements? Approvals? Due diligence records? Reporting?\nFinally, as small improvements in users’ needs snowball, a PDB can look further outward to impacts in the wider economy. For example, the Development Bank of Nigeria has prioritised collecting and using data well. At first it focused on data for performance and customer service improvements, but as it grows in its customer base and accumulation of valuable data it is increasingly able to draw on key data points to contribute policy or macroeconomic insights.\n3. Help businesses develop digital skills\nMany PDBs offer training programs to help new businesses get off their feet. Programs might include business planning, accounting and financial management, marketing and etc. Recently, the Development Bank of Jamaica, which runs a  voucher program for technical assistance, released a ‘digital transformation’ voucher allowing eligible borrowers to access business support services targeted at improving borrowers’ online/digital capabilities.\nTechnology and digital applications can enable wide-spread and lower-cost distribution of business training programs (even youtube for example).  The Development Bank of Nigeria has taken this approach. Its mandate is to focus on micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and improve their access to finance.\nTo this end, it has released a mobile app which, among other features, offers training videos aimed at improving the business skills of current and prospective MSME borrowers — ultimately improving their ‘bankability’ (their likelihood of repaying credit and attractiveness to lenders).\nIn some contexts, particularly remote areas, citizens can be unfamiliar with digital financial services.

Usually their board members include members of government. Staff, particularly executives, can be porous between government and commercial banking.\nThey are often an independent agency under a key ministry e.g of finance, agriculture, trade etc. They are usually not regulated like a commercial bank, but often have close relationships with regulatory authorities while existing under an independent legislative act.\nThese attributes together mean that PDBs occupy a unique policy position. They have the opportunity to sit at a policy table and advocate for the betterment of financial services, and regulations that improve economic development and financial inclusion.\nIn this way, as digital standards and regulation are nascent in many contexts, development banks have the opportunity to relay the needs of citizens and the financial industry to policy makers to see innovation and inclusive digital transformation occur.\nBy example, countries that adopt proportionate, risk-based tiered know-your-customer regulations (KYC), that allow the opening of small accounts without the requirements imposed on larger accounts, have shown to broaden access to financial services and financial inclusion in general. Development banks are well positioned to advocate for this kind of Fintech enabling regulation.\nConclusion\nDevelopment banks have an opportunity to increase financial inclusion and contribute to a broader digital financial ecosystem.

The typical Resident Enumerator in <a href=\"https://www.ictworks.org/tag/dr-congo/\">DR Congo</a> has limited technology experience and even less comfort with internet-based tools.</p>\n<p>As for Pierre, the principal investigator at Performance Monitoring for Action DRC, not only had he never designed or led a remote learning event; his experience even as a remote <em>learner</em> was very limited.</p>\n<p>Thinking back on this initial phase with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarahnehrling/\">Sarah Nehrling</a>, he remembered his reticence. &#8220;I was not for it, I was not willing to do it. If already I didn’t have much experience as a learner, how could I train others?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Internet availability, literacy, and accessibility are still <a href=\"https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2020-democratic-republic-of-the-congo\">very low in DRC</a>. Only 19% of the population was connected to internet in January 2020, with only 3.5% of the population active on social media. One major factor is cost. <a href=\"https://a4ai.org/affordability-report/report/2020/\">1GB cost 26.2% of a person’s total income in DRC</a>.</p>\n<p>And yet, Pierre and his team ended up leading a very successful remote enumerator training. Twenty-five enumerators and five supervisors participated in a 3-day semi-synchronous training, following the training plan and platform that Pierre and his colleagues co-developed and piloted with Sarah and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/shani-turke/\">Shani Turke</a>.</p>\n<p>They received step-by-step instructions for each training session in a main <a href=\"https://www.ictworks.org/tag/whatsapp/\">WhatsApp group</a>, along with links to where to find the video, activity sheet, or quiz for that session. They asked and responded to questions in another WhatsApp group, and they could connect with their small working group for more personalized questions, support, and activity partnering in a third WhatsApp group.</p>\n<p>At the end of the remote training, the enumerators&#8217; test results were just as good as during previous in-person trainings, and their phone call-based data collection once again provided high-quality and rapid-turnaround data, as is <a href=\"https://www.pmadata.org/\">PMA&#8217;s mission and reputation</a>.</p>\n<p>Pierre suggests that our own mindsets, particularly a fear of innovation and trying new things, are the first and most challenging obstacles to acknowledge and overcome when holding our trainings online in LMICs in 2020 and 2021. Not technology access and connectivity despite the typical emphasis on infrastructure and materials.</p>\n<h2>4 Ways to Online Training Success in 2021</h2>\n<p>As you begin to build out your plans for 2021, full of uncertainty about what type of learning will be possible, Pierre has some advice to help you and your teams make the transition to a learning-centered and tech-friendly mindset that will enable you to embrace and elevate the opportunities for remote learning in 2021.</p>\n<h3>1. Evolve with the World &#8211; thoughtfully</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ictworks.org/tag/covid-19-response/\">COVID-19 Digital Response</a> this year may have made us all think differently about remote collaboration and learning, but the basic technology that allows it has been around for over a decade. The technological evolution is like a passing train: when it comes by, either we get on it, or it leaves us behind.</p>\n<p>Of course, blindly adopting technology can be a recipe for disaster. Pierre&#8217;s initial reticence about remote training was valid, and he knew he had to test the remote training system for himself before even thinking about involving others.</p>\n<p>So he and his team underwent a pre-test, playing the roles of trainers and learners in the system, which was built around a structured use of WhatsApp and Google Drive. &#8220;<em>Our response was, &#8216;yes, we&#8217;ll do this, but we reserve the possibility to turn around&#8217;, based on how the pre-test went.</em>&#8221; Throughout the pre-test, they were driven by a curiosity to learn this new system and to evaluate its feasibility for their learners.</p>\n<p>They saw that the videos and materials were clear and visible, and that the offline options safeguarded against the inevitable challenges of low-bandwidth and unreliable internet. And, with this successful pre-test, they launched into preparations!</p>\n<h3>2. Lean into adaptation and reactivity</h3>\n<p>NOW is the time to adapt and react, as we do not know when or if things will go back to normal, and we cannot simply sit around and wait. Pierre and his team weighed their immediate options: do they risk everyone’s health by holding an in-person training? Or do they attempt <a href=\"https://www.ictworks.org/tag/distance-learning/\">distance learning</a> to provide at least some instruction in a safe way?</p>\n<p>They also considered the longer-term implications: Do they want to assume that they will be able to return to safe in-person trainings in the near future? Or do they want to begin to prepare their teams now for what might be a long stretch of time without these in-person trainings?</p>\n<blockquote><p>“We told ourselves that we can’t really move around, so we need to adapt now in order to keep working, to be useful in a situation where conditions mean that we can’t move.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>In adapting and reacting to the current situation, the team designed and discovered new things that will continue to serve them, far beyond this pandemic.</p>\n<p>For example, despite their best efforts, some enumerators would inevitably arrive late during in-person training days, because of unpredictable events at home or, most often, major traffic jams on the way to the training.</p>\n<p>The remote, semi-asynchronous training allowed women to manage their household responsibilities, avoid traffic altogether, and always be on time. The gain of not having to travel and the flexibility of the semi-asynchronous structure allowed women to learn on their schedules, without missing content, and without being late.</p>\n<h3>3. Plan Well: Failing to plan is planning to fail</h3>\n<p>This adage is doubly important when it comes to trying new things and leveraging new or internet-dependent technologies. Take time to think about every single obstacle that your team might encounter when preparing and leading an online training, and reach out to people with relevant experience for advice and support. With their fresh and formative experience, Pierre and his team, along with their enumerators, are happy to be amongst those you reach out to for advice.</p>\n<p>For their remote training, it was clear that the ability to access the majority of materials without an internet connection was crucial. By using Google Drive&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.ictworks.org/lesson-learned-offline-key/\">offline content</a> sync option, a new feature for them, they were able to sync materials to all smartphones <em>before </em>dispatching them to enumerators.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;The internet connection was a huge barrier, but a barrier that we could overcome!&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>While Pierre and his team opted into the remote training format, he knew that his enumerators had less of a choice if they wanted to keep working. While some enumerators were already active on social media, others had never even used WhatsApp, the app that would constitute the central space for the remote training system, through different designated groups for sharing content, asking questions, and working with others.</p>\n<p>The enumerators needed a bridge to this new remote system, something to help them feel generally comfortable with these tools before they were expected to use them to learn. Pierre created a video that explained how the training would be run and what would be expected of them, including reassurances that WhatsApp was not so different from the SMS system they already used and that the training team would be available to support them.</p>\n<p>He then created the large WhatsApp group of all enumerators, invited everyone to join, and shared the video through WhatsApp. On the first day of training, to ensure that the enumerators were present and able to access and look through the WhatsApp exchanges, he asked them to all send photos of themselves to the group; quickly, the group space was filled with photos of enumerators, sitting in their homes with their smartphones and field manuals!</p>\n<h3>4. Trust your collaborators with learning opportunities:</h3>\n<p>When we learn, we enrich ourselves. Being able to design and facilitate an in-person event is good; being able to design and facilitate a remote event is even better.</p>\n<p>Once they were committed to running the remote training, Pierre&#8217;s team learned what they needed when they needed it, with the support of prepared training of trainers materials as well as support staff and public online resources. When they needed to learn how to send a Google Form, they learned it. When they needed to learn how to share an invitation link to WhatsApp by SMS blast, they learned it.</p>\n<p>Once they were put in a situation of remote learning, the enumerators also learned about how to be strong remote learners. Not only did they become familiar and comfortable with WhatsApp and Google Drive, they also learned:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How to organize their learning tasks around other responsibilities.</li>\n<li>How to reach out to fellow remote learners and supervisors for help.</li>\n<li>How to record and share their summaries of what they learned that day.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The enumerators were proud of themselves for being successful in this new opportunity, and Pierre was glad to have dared to bring it to them.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;They can do big things! But we&#8217;d never dared to challenge them. With a remote training, I&#8217;m giving something extra to the enumerators, something that they&#8217;ve never benefitted from before. It&#8217;s a bonus to have the skill to participate in a remote training, and that&#8217;s something that they otherwise would not have had.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>People are naturally scared of what they don’t know, says Pierre. He himself started out sometimes hostile about innovation. Not everyone is ready to adopt innovative approaches. You need to help them to understand the advantages and the risks. And once they&#8217;ve seen it, they can become big fans. But first, you need to dare to try it first.</p>\n<p><em>By Pierre Akilimali, Associate Professor, Kinshasa School of Public Health; Principal Investigator, PMA DRC and </em><em>Sarah Nehrling, organizational learning consultant, Garabam Consulting</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ictworks.org/challenge-remote-training-success-drc/\">The Surprising Challenge to Remote Training Success in DRC</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ictworks.org\">ICTworks</a>.</p>\n",

They asked and responded to questions in another WhatsApp group, and they could connect with their small working group for more personalized questions, support, and activity partnering in a third WhatsApp group.\nAt the end of the remote training, the enumerators’ test results were just as good as during previous in-person trainings, and their phone call-based data collection once again provided high-quality and rapid-turnaround data, as is PMA’s mission and reputation.\nPierre suggests that our own mindsets, particularly a fear of innovation and trying new things, are the first and most challenging obstacles to acknowledge and overcome when holding our trainings online in LMICs in 2020 and 2021. Not technology access and connectivity despite the typical emphasis on infrastructure and materials.\n4 Ways to Online Training Success in 2021\nAs you begin to build out your plans for 2021, full of uncertainty about what type of learning will be possible, Pierre has some advice to help you and your teams make the transition to a learning-centered and tech-friendly mindset that will enable you to embrace and elevate the opportunities for remote learning in 2021.\n1. Evolve with the World – thoughtfully\nCOVID-19 Digital Response this year may have made us all think differently about remote collaboration and learning, but the basic technology that allows it has been around for over a decade. The technological evolution is like a passing train: when it comes by, either we get on it, or it leaves us behind.\nOf course, blindly adopting technology can be a recipe for disaster. Pierre’s initial reticence about remote training was valid, and he knew he had to test the remote training system for himself before even thinking about involving others.\nSo he and his team underwent a pre-test, playing the roles of trainers and learners in the system, which was built around a structured use of WhatsApp and Google Drive. “Our response was, ‘yes, we’ll do this, but we reserve the possibility to turn around’, based on how the pre-test went.” Throughout the pre-test, they were driven by a curiosity to learn this new system and to evaluate its feasibility for their learners.\nThey saw that the videos and materials were clear and visible, and that the offline options safeguarded against the inevitable challenges of low-bandwidth and unreliable internet. And, with this successful pre-test, they launched into preparations!\n2. Lean into adaptation and reactivity\nNOW is the time to adapt and react, as we do not know when or if things will go back to normal, and we cannot simply sit around and wait. Pierre and his team weighed their immediate options: do they risk everyone’s health by holding an in-person training? Or do they attempt distance learning to provide at least some instruction in a safe way?\nThey also considered the longer-term implications: Do they want to assume that they will be able to return to safe in-person trainings in the near future? Or do they want to begin to prepare their teams now for what might be a long stretch of time without these in-person trainings?\n“We told ourselves that we can’t really move around, so we need to adapt now in order to keep working, to be useful in a situation where conditions mean that we can’t move.”\n\nIn adapting and reacting to the current situation, the team designed and discovered new things that will continue to serve them, far beyond this pandemic.\nFor example, despite their best efforts, some enumerators would inevitably arrive late during in-person training days, because of unpredictable events at home or, most often, major traffic jams on the way to the training.\nThe remote, semi-asynchronous training allowed women to manage their household responsibilities, avoid traffic altogether, and always be on time. The gain of not having to travel and the flexibility of the semi-asynchronous structure allowed women to learn on their schedules, without missing content, and without being late.\n3. Plan Well: Failing to plan is planning to fail\nThis adage is doubly important when it comes to trying new things and leveraging new or internet-dependent technologies. Take time to think about every single obstacle that your team might encounter when preparing and leading an online training, and reach out to people with relevant experience for advice and support. With their fresh and formative experience, Pierre and his team, along with their enumerators, are happy to be amongst those you reach out to for advice.\nFor their remote training, it was clear that the ability to access the majority of materials without an internet connection was crucial. By using Google Drive’s offline content sync option, a new feature for them, they were able to sync materials to all smartphones before dispatching them to enumerators.\n“The internet connection was a huge barrier, but a barrier that we could overcome!”\n\nWhile Pierre and his team opted into the remote training format, he knew that his enumerators had less of a choice if they wanted to keep working. While some enumerators were already active on social media, others had never even used WhatsApp, the app that would constitute the central space for the remote training system, through different designated groups for sharing content, asking questions, and working with others.\nThe enumerators needed a bridge to this new remote system, something to help them feel generally comfortable with these tools before they were expected to use them to learn. Pierre created a video that explained how the training would be run and what would be expected of them, including reassurances that WhatsApp was not so different from the SMS system they already used and that the training team would be available to support them.\nHe then created the large WhatsApp group of all enumerators, invited everyone to join, and shared the video through WhatsApp. On the first day of training, to ensure that the enumerators were present and able to access and look through the WhatsApp exchanges, he asked them to all send photos of themselves to the group; quickly, the group space was filled with photos of enumerators, sitting in their homes with their smartphones and field manuals!\n4. Trust your collaborators with learning opportunities:\nWhen we learn, we enrich ourselves. Being able to design and facilitate an in-person event is good; being able to design and facilitate a remote event is even better.\nOnce they were committed to running the remote training, Pierre’s team learned what they needed when they needed it, with the support of prepared training of trainers materials as well as support staff and public online resources. When they needed to learn how to send a Google Form, they learned it. When they needed to learn how to share an invitation link to WhatsApp by SMS blast, they learned it.\nOnce they were put in a situation of remote learning, the enumerators also learned about how to be strong remote learners. Not only did they become familiar and comfortable with WhatsApp and Google Drive, they also learned:\nHow to organize their learning tasks around other responsibilities.\nHow to reach out to fellow remote learners and supervisors for help.\nHow to record and share their summaries of what they learned that day.\nThe enumerators were proud of themselves for being successful in this new opportunity, and Pierre was glad to have dared to bring it to them.\n“They can do big things! But we’d never dared to challenge them. With a remote training, I’m giving something extra to the enumerators, something that they’ve never benefitted from before. It’s a bonus to have the skill to participate in a remote training, and that’s something that they otherwise would not have had.”\n\nPeople are naturally scared of what they don’t know, says Pierre. He himself started out sometimes hostile about innovation. Not everyone is ready to adopt innovative approaches. You need to help them to understand the advantages and the risks. And once they’ve seen it, they can become big fans. But first, you need to dare to try it first.\nBy Pierre Akilimali, Associate Professor, Kinshasa School of Public Health; Principal Investigator, PMA DRC and Sarah Nehrling, organizational learning consultant, Garabam Consulting\nThe post The Surprising Challenge to Remote Training Success in DRC appeared first on ICTworks.",
